# Personal-Dashboard

<p>Gives you the current time, weather, nice background image and a random quote. </p>
<p>Used a weather API, UnSplash API and random quote API.</p>
<p> Additionally I've made it into a Chrome Extension, such that every time a new tab is opened on the browser, I get a new instance of the dashboard.</p>
